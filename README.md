# An Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns

# Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project is to give Louisa insight into how some campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

# Analysis and Challenges 
The analysis includes a look into the number of theater campaigns that were successful, failed, and canceled based on the months they were launched. As seen in the graph, there was an upward trend for successful campaigns launched at the beginning of the year with a spike in March, and then a downward trend for the rest of the year.

When creating the table used for the "Outcomes based on Goals" graph, a difficulty faced was referencing data in a different worksheet to use in the COUNTIFS formulas. This challenge was overcome by copying the formula used for one column to other columns and editing it accordingly.
